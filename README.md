## 📚 What You'll Learn

This course builds your foundation in advanced algorithm design focused on **parameterized complexity theory**. You'll explore how to tackle NP-hard problems using problem-specific parameters.

```python
def parameterized_skills():
    return [
        "Kernelization (e.g., vertex cover kernels)",
        "FPT Algorithms (e.g., 2^O(k) · poly(n) runtimes)",
        "Treewidth and Tree Decompositions",
        "Color-Coding and Probabilistic Techniques",
        "W[1]/W[2]-Hardness Reductions"
    ]
```
